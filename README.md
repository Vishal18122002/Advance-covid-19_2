# Advanced COVID-19 Prediction with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to provide advanced predictive models for COVID-19 spread using deep learning techniques. Leveraging deep neural networks, we seek to forecast infection rates, transmission patterns, and potential outbreaks with higher accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as LSTM, CNN, and Transformer for robust prediction.
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Incorporates various factors including demographics, mobility data, weather conditions, and government interventions to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implements a pipeline for real-time data ingestion, model training, and prediction deployment to adapt to evolving scenarios.
- **Visualization**: Provides intuitive visualization tools to present predictions, trends, and model performance metrics.

### Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:
   - Ensure you have access to COVID-19 datasets including infection data, mobility data, and relevant features.
   - Preprocess the data and format it according to the provided templates.

2. Train the model:
   - Run the training script, specifying the desired model architecture and hyperparameters.
   - Monitor training progress and adjust parameters as necessary.

3. Evaluate the model:
   - Evaluate the trained model on validation data to assess its performance.
   - Fine-tune the model architecture or training process as needed.

4. Make predictions:
   - Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new data.
   - Visualize predictions and insights using the provided tools.
